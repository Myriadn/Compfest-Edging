## Overview
A slackline circus performer from a dystopian world plagued by poverty and destruction caused by a corrupt government, she had been part of a false spectacle for far too long, entertaining those who oppressed him while harboring wounds that could never be shown.

Until one cold, quiet night, he decided to leave. Out of the circus. Out of the city filled with lies and the greed of the government. She didnâ€™t know what lay beyond. Was there another world beyond the towering walls? Was there still a forest said to be dead?

She believed it was better to walk into uncertainty than to rot in the greed of that city.
